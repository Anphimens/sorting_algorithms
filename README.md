# Sorting algorithms & Big O
This is a group project of two students of ALXSE.


## Sorting algorithm
In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.


## Big O Notation
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behaviour of a function when the argument approaches a particular value or infinity. In computer science, Big O notation is commonly used to analyze and describe the efficiency of algorithms in terms of their time complexity or space complexity.

The notation is expressed as `O(f(n))`, where `O` stands for order, and `f(n)` represents a function that characterizes the performance of the algorithm. The variable `n` usually represents the input size of the algorithm.

The Big O notation helps in providing an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's resource usage (time or space) in the worst-case scenario. It provides a way to describe how the performance of an algorithm scales with the size of the input, without focusing on the exact details of the algorithm or the constant factors.

### Here are some common examples of Big O notations:

+ `O(1)`: Constant time complexity - The algorithm's performance does not depend on the size of the input.

- `O(log n)`: Logarithmic time complexity - The algorithm's performance grows logarithmically with the size of the input.

* `O(n)`: Linear time complexity - The algorithm's performance grows linearly with the size of the input.

+ `O(n log n)`: Linearithmic time complexity - Common in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and heap sort.

- `O(n^2)`: Quadratic time complexity - The performance is proportional to the square of the size of the input.

+ `O(2^n)`: Exponential time complexity - The performance grows exponentially with the size of the input.
